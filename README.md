# Maze-Game

This is a text-based adventure game that uses the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming and utilizes Data structures to function.
 
The game is based on a maze. Initially you are at starting room which is ‘A’, and your aim to reach the target room. So, for that you have to navigate through other rooms to get your target room. And each room have some connection between them, so that you can navigate through them. The neighboring rooms are listed to your North, South, East and West positions respectively. While navigating through the rooms, when you don’t find a neighbor, it means you don’t have a neighbor at that particular location. And basically, the rooms are labelled by Alphabets.

Here we take the starting room as room ‘A’, and the target room is room ‘T’. So you want to reach the target room, starting from room ‘A’ by navigating through other rooms.
